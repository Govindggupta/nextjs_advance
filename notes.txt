#Route groups 
if you name a folder with "(name)" in folders , then you don't need to write this as route in the url. this is ignored as route in routing. 
So you this feature when you want to group routes in a folder but don't want that folder as route name in the url 
eg : (auth)
       |
       -----> signin 
       |
       -----> signup 
so now you don't need to write : auth/signin or auth/signup 
you can directly write : /signup and /signin 


#Layout.tsx 
This file is used to wrap all the file or route in that particular root / parent folder to be a similar route . So wrap all the children in root / parent folder in layout.tsx 

#Dynamic Routes 
In this you name a folder with "[slug]" , by this , you can dynamically change page for diff slug and writing the same code with page.tsx and then by taking slug from the param you can render things dynamically.

In Next.js, dynamic routes allow you to create pages that change based on the URL. You can do this by naming a folder [slug], which acts as a placeholder for different values. Inside page.tsx, you can access the slug from params and use it to dynamically display content without writing multiple pages


#Catch-all segment [...slug] 
so this is used to catch all the slug after the route , for eg if i make a route courseId/[...segment] 
then in the url whatever i write after the courseId , if will catch all of them and give an array of all of them 

and if you make it [[...slug]]
then it would render for /courseId as well , so we don't need to make another page.tsx for /courseId 

but better approach is to make another page.tsx
